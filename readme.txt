### 🎬 Movie Recommendation Systems – Comparative Analysis
This project explores and compares multiple movie recommender system architectures using the MovieLens 1M dataset.
### 🧠 Project Overview
The aim of this assignment was to design, implement, and evaluate different approaches to movie recommendation — moving from classical collaborative filtering to modern machine learning–based models.
Three key recommendation strategies were examined:
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering – predicts preferences based on similar users.
- Item-Based + Content Hybrid Filtering – enhances similarity calculations with genre information.
- Modern Recommender (Matrix Factorisation / FunkSVD) – a machine-learning approach that learns hidden user and item features for personalised recommendations. 

Each system was evaluated using standard performance metrics such as RMSE, Average Precision (AP), and NDCG, allowing for a clear comparison of their accuracy and ranking quality.
### 📊 What This Project Demonstrates
Practical application of machine learning in recommender systems.
Comparative analysis showing how hybrid and latent-factor models outperform traditional methods.
Data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result visualisation using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
### 🧩 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook for reproducible experimentation
Dataset: MovieLens 1M (GroupLens Research)
### 🏁 Outcome
This project highlights how incorporating content features and matrix factorisation techniques significantly improves recommendation accuracy and personalisation — reflecting real-world approaches used by platforms like Netflix and Spotify.
